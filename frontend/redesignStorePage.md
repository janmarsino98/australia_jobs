# Store Page Redesign Plan

## Current Issues Analysis

The current StorePage has several design problems that detract from a modern, minimalistic experience:

1. **Visual Hierarchy Problems**
   - Oversized emoji in header (ðŸš€) feels unprofessional
   - Too much text in hero section creates visual clutter
   - Poor spacing between sections

2. **Layout Issues**
   - Single-column layout doesn't utilize screen space efficiently
   - Fixed cart icon overlaps content on smaller screens
   - Header section takes up too much vertical space

3. **Typography Problems**
   - Multiple heading levels create confusion
   - Inconsistent text sizing and spacing
   - Color usage doesn't follow design system properly

4. **Component Structure**
   - Header section is inline instead of being a reusable component
   - No clear separation between hero and product sections
   - Missing modern UI elements like breadcrumbs or progress indicators
