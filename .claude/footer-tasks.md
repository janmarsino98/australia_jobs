# Footer and Legal Pages - Implementation Tasks

## Current Situation Analysis

### ✅ What Already Exists:
1. **Legal Pages**: All three legal pages are already created and comprehensive:
   - `PrivacyPolicyPage.tsx` - Complete privacy policy compliant with international standards
   - `TermsOfServicePage.tsx` - Comprehensive terms of service for Australian jurisdiction
   - `CookiePolicyPage.tsx` - Detailed cookie policy with GDPR compliance features

2. **Footer Component**: `MainFooter.tsx` exists with proper legal links:
   - Links to `/privacy-policy`, `/terms-of-service`, and `/cookie-policy`
   - Proper navigation structure with job seekers, employers, and company sections
   - Modern responsive design with hover effects

3. **Routing**: All legal pages are properly configured in `routes.tsx`:
   - Routes are accessible publicly (no authentication required)
   - URLs match the footer links exactly

### ❌ Current Issues:
1. **Footer Usage**: The footer is only used on the Landing page (`Landing.tsx`)
2. **Inconsistent Layout**: Most pages use `AppLayout` which only includes Navbar, not footer
3. **Individual Page Footers**: Some pages like `PricingInformationPage.tsx` have their own inline footer code

## Tasks to Complete

### Phase 1: Footer Integration Strategy
1. **Update AppLayout to include MainFooter**
   - Modify `AppLayout.tsx` to include `MainFooter` at the bottom
   - This will automatically add footer to all pages using AppLayout
   - Ensure proper styling and spacing

2. **Remove redundant footer from individual pages**
   - Remove inline footer from `PricingInformationPage.tsx` (lines 180-197)
   - Scan other pages for similar inline footers and remove them
   - Ensure no duplicate footers appear

3. **Update pages that don't use AppLayout**
   - Check if there are pages not using AppLayout that need footer
   - Add MainFooter component to those pages individually
